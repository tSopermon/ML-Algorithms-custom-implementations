This repository compares the performance of Adaline, Logistic Regression, and Perceptron models on binary classification tasks using linearly, non-linearly, and marginally separable datasets from the Iris dataset. It includes MATLAB implementations, 10-fold cross-validation, and visualizations of decision boundaries and MSE histories.
